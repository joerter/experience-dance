      "description": "Balanchine’s multifaceted talent is showcased in a program uniting three classic works. Concerto Barocco, from 1941, is set to Bach’s Concerto in D Minor for Two Violins, and features crystalline choreography for the two lead ballerinas, each representing the voice of one violin, as well as a male dancer and a small corps de ballet. For Allegro Brillante Balanchine returned to a favorite composer, Tschaikovsky, to create a scintillating dance that combines lyricism and buoyancy. Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet features a cast of more than 50 dancers in a ballet that, in four distinct movements, pays homage to the Romantic era as epitomized by Brahms’s music, filtered through the distinct modernist style of Arnold Schoenberg.",
